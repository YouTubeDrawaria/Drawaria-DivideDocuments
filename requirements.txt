Here’s a basic `requirements.txt` file for **Drawaria DivideDocuments**. This assumes the tool uses common libraries for document processing, such as `PyPDF2` for PDFs and `python-docx` for Word documents. Adjust it based on your specific implementation:

```plaintext
# requirements.txt

# Core libraries
PyPDF2==3.0.0          # For PDF document processing
python-docx==0.8.11    # For DOCX document processing
python-magic==0.4.27   # For file type detection
pytest==7.4.0          # For testing (optional)

# Additional utilities
tqdm==4.66.1           # For progress bars (optional)
```

### Notes:
- If you’re working with other file formats (e.g., `.txt`), no additional libraries are needed.
- If you plan to add more advanced features (e.g., OCR for scanned PDFs), you might need libraries like `PyMuPDF` or `pytesseract`.
- Make sure to update the versions as needed for compatibility.

To install the dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
